\section*{Introduction to Network Security}

Possible threats to network security:

\begin{itemize}
    \item DDoS attacks
    \item Unauthorized access to servers, computers, and data
    \item Malware injection
    \item Unauthorized data modification and deletion
    \item Unauthorized usage of resources
    \item Damage to customers
    \item Usage of social engineering
    \item Advanced persistent threats (APTs)
\end{itemize}

The attack may come from other trusted networks or it may come from inside.

\begin{description}
    \item[C]- Confidentiality
    \item[I]- Integrity
    \item[A]- Availability 
\end{description}

\subsection*{Threats to Confidentiality:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unauthorized access to network
    \item Malicious software injection
    \item Unauthorized access to data stored in the network
    \item Unauthorized access to the data in transit
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Threats to Integrity:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Malicious software injection
    \item Unauthorized modification/deletion of data
    \item Unauthorized changes to the configuration of network devices and servers
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Threats to Availability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item DDoS attacks
    \item Malicious software injections
    \item Unauthorized modification/deletion of data
    \item Data availability attacks (i.e., ransomware)
    \item Unauthorized changes to the configuration of network devices and servers
\end{itemize}

Consider the capability of the adversaries and protection requirements because deploying everything you got will be very expensive, add unnecessary cost to each protection mechanism, bring difficulties to perform daily business operations.

You have to strike a balance between protection and availability.

\subsection*{Different classifications of adversaries:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Active/passive adversaries
    \item Inside/outside adversaries
    \item Purpose of possible attacks
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Protection requirements for assets:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Confidentiality
    \item Integrity
    \item Replay protection
    \item Non-repudiation
    \item Prevention of malicious usage
    \item Prevention of unauthorized access
\end{itemize}

If there's no sensitive data to protect then there's no need to introduce overhead by encryption.

The general approach to network security is to take all the input and output doors to the network under control.

\subsection*{Defense mechanisms in network security:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perimeter security
    \end{itemize}
    \item Software/hardware
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Firewall
        \item WAF
        \item SIEM
        \item IDS/IPS
        \item DDoS prevention
        \item IDM (identity management)
        \item NAC (network access control)
        \item EDR (endpoint detection and response)
        \item SOAR (security orchestration automation and response)
        \item Vulnerability management
        \item Pentest
        \item Policies, procedures
        \item Compliance checks
        \item Anomaly detection
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cryptography and secure communication
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Questions and Answers:}
\textbf{Q:} Since we have these many tools that protect our network, is it still necessary to use cryptography?

\textbf{A:} Yes, it is needed. Because when the data leaves the network it needs to be protected. It also needs to be protected when it is in transit in the network and of course it needs to be protected when at rest.

Cryptography and secure communication provide confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, authentication.

\textbf{Q:} If everyone is the receiver, is it necessary to establish a secure channel? (Clue: Consider GPS)

We need to define the risks, the adversaries, and the adversaries' capabilities. Define what we need. Define what the adversaries can do.

\subsection*{Potential of adversaries:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Passive attacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unauthorized access to information (confidentiality)
        \item Traffic analysis
    \end{itemize}
    \item Active attacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Impersonation
        \item Replay attack (A malicious actor intercepting and retransmitting data to produce an unauthorized effect, often deceiving a system into granting access or performing an unintended action.)
        \item Message modification
        \item Denial of service (by disrupting the communication)
        \item Repudiation
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security solutions on network layers:}
TCP/IP divides the networking function into 4 layers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application layer: PGP
    \item Transport layer: TLS
    \item Network layer: IPSec
    \item Datalink layer
\end{itemize}

\section*{Introduction to Cryptology}

Cryptologyy: Practice and study of techniques based on mathematical and computational problems for secure communication. It alone is not enough for security but it is an essential tool.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discrete Logarithm Problem} (DLP):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What it is:} Given a base \( g \), a modulus \( p \), and a result \( h \), the discrete logarithm problem is to find an exponent \( x \) such that \( g^x \equiv h \pmod{p} \). In simpler terms, if you know \( g \) raised to some power \( x \) gives you \( h \), the problem is to find that power \( x \).
        \item \textbf{Why it's important:} DLP is the foundation for many cryptographic protocols, including the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). The difficulty of solving the DLP provides the security behind these protocols.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integer Factorization Problem}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What it is:} Given a composite number \( n \), the integer factorization problem involves expressing \( n \) as a product of its prime factors.
        \item \textbf{Why it's important:} The security of the widely used RSA encryption algorithm relies on the difficulty of factorizing large integers. If you can factorize the RSA modulus, you can derive the private key from the public key and break the encryption.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Solution of Complex Equation Systems}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{What it is:} This involves finding solutions to systems of equations that may have multiple variables and can be nonlinear. These equations can be polynomial, exponential, or of other forms.
        \item \textbf{Why it's important:} Solving complex equation systems has applications in various fields, including optimization, computer algebra, and some cryptographic attacks. The difficulty of solving these systems can also be used as a basis for cryptographic security in certain scenarios.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

In the context of cryptography, these problems are computationally hard to solve, especially as the input size grows. This "hardness" provides the security foundation for various cryptographic schemes.

\subsection*{Use cases:}
\begin{description}
    \item[Confidentiality:] Only authorized parties can access data.
    \item[Non-repudiation:] The sender cannot dispute the origin of the data.
    \item[Integrity:] Data cannot be modified by unauthorized parties.
    \item[Authentication:] Identification of the entities are proved.
    \item[Secret sharing:] A secret is shared between \(n\) parties and any \(k\) out of \(n\) parties can construct the secret.
    \item[Secure multi-party computation:] Parties want to compute a function using their private data but they don't want to leak their data to each other.
    \item[Privacy:] Parties want to hide their identities and their data while utilizng comm. and computation. 
\end{description}

\subsection*{Cryptology}
Cryptology is divided into two main subfields:
\begin{description}
    \item[Cryptography:] Design of cryptographic solutions. 
    \item[Cryptoanalysis:] Security anaylsis of cryptographic solutions.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Basic Encryption Model}

\textbf{Kerckhoffs' Principle (1883):} \\
\emph{``Security should not rely on the secrecy of the algorithm; everything may be known but the key.''}

\[D(k_d, E(k_e, p)) = p\]

\begin{description}
    \item[\(D\):] Decryption
    \item[\(E\):] Encryption
    \item[\(k_d\):] Decryption key
    \item[\(k_e\):] Encryption key
    \item[\(p\):] Plaintext     
    \item[\(c\):] Ciphertext 
\end{description}

\subsection*{Adversary model}
\textbf{Questions for modelling:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can the adversary learn the encrypted data?
    
    \emph{Sniffs the network}
    \item Can the adversary modify the encrypted data?
    
    \emph{Sniffs the network, modifies the data and sends the data to the receiver}
    \item Can the adversary sit between the communicating parties?
    
    \emph{Changes the proxy configurations in the computer of the victim}
    \item What is the computation power of the adversary?
    
    \emph{May have thousands of computation cores. Lets assume one core performs 232
    operations in 1 minute. One core can compute \(232 \times 60 \times 24 \times 365 \times 1000 \cong 261\)
    operations in 1000 years. The adversary can perform \(261 \times 1000000 \cong 281\) operations
    if he/she has 1 million computation cores. That is this adversary can learn the 80-bit
    secret key of an encryption algorithm by brute-force attack in 250 years in average.}
    \item Can the adversary learn corresponding ciphertext for the plaintext chosen by himself online or offline?
    
    \emph{Assume that in a cryptographic protocol, party A sends a challenge (random number) to
    be encrypted to party B to authenticate party B. The adversary can use party B as an
    encryption oracle, sends a plaintext and party B returns the corresponding ciphertext.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Some adversary models regarding data usable by the adversary}
\begin{description}
    \item[Known plaintext attack (KPA):] The adversary knows plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
    \item[Ciphertext-only attack (COA):] The adversary only knows ciphertexts.
    \item[Chosen plaintext attack (CPA):] The adversary can learn encryption result of any plaintext chosen by the adversary.
    \item[Chosen ciphertext attack (CCA):] The adversary can learn decryption result of any ciphertext chosen by the adversary.
    \item[Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2):] The adversary can learn decryption result of any ciphertext chosen by the adversary during the attack.
    \item[Adaptive chosen plaintext attack (CPA2):] The adversary can learn encryption result of any plaintext chosen by the adversary during the attack.     
\end{description}


\subsection*{Security Definition}

\noindent\textbf{Definition:}
An encryption algorithm is said to be \textbf{secure} if the difference between:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The probability of determining partial information about the plaintext for a given ciphertext, and
    \item The probability of determining partial information about the plaintext without the given ciphertext,
\end{itemize}
is negligible.

\noindent Mathematically, this can be represented as:
\[ \text{Pr} [p|c] - \text{Pr}[p] = \varepsilon \]

\noindent\textbf{In other words:}
The adversary should not have any advantage in learning additional information about the plaintext when he knows the ciphertext.

\noindent\textbf{Illustration:}
In an example where the plaintext space consists of alphabetical characters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Without the ciphertext, the adversary already knows that the plaintext consists of alphabetical characters.
    \item Possessing the ciphertext should not increase the adversary's knowledge about the plaintext, assuming the encryption algorithm is secure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Historical Encryption Examples}

\noindent\textbf{Shift Ciphers (Caesar Ciphers):}

Shift ciphers, one of the earliest encryption techniques, involve shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Given an \( n \)-letter alphabet, where \( p \), \( c \), and \( k \) are elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_n \):
\begin{align*}
    E_k(p) &= (p + k) \mod n \\
    D_k(c) &= (c - k) \mod n
\end{align*}

\textbf{Security Analysis:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is this cipher secure? It's considered insecure by modern standards due to its simplicity.
    \item Key Recovery: One can employ an exhaustive key search (brute-force attack). Given that there are only \( n \) possible shifts, an attacker can systematically try each shift until the correct decryption is found.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Substitution Cipher:}

In substitution ciphers, each letter or symbol in the plaintext is replaced by another letter or symbol.

Given \( p, c \in \mathbb{Z}_n \); \( k \) is a bijection, \( f \), over \( \mathbb{Z}_n \):
\begin{align*}
    E_k(p) &= f(p) \\
    D_k(c) &= f^{-1}(c)
\end{align*}

\textbf{Security Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Brute-force? The number of possible keys is \( n! \). For a 26-letter alphabet, it is approximately \( 2^{88} \), making brute-force impractical.
    \item Frequency Analysis: By computing the distribution of letters in the ciphertext and comparing to known letter distributions in the language, one can deduce likely substitutions.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Permutation Cipher:}

In permutation ciphers, the letters of the plaintext are rearranged according to a pre-defined system or pattern.

\textbf{Security Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The key is essentially the specific permutation used.
    \item Brute-force? The number of possible keys for 30-letter messages is \( 30! \), approximately \( 2^{108} \).
    \item Cryptanalysis: The cipher can potentially be broken using statistics of the language or known plaintext attacks.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{One-Time Pad (Vernam Cipher, 1917):}

The One-Time Pad (OTP) requires a key that is as long as the message and is used only once.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Shannon's Proof (1949): OTP offers perfect secrecy.
    \item If \( \text{Pr } p_c - \text{Pr } p = \epsilon \) and this difference is 0, then the encryption has perfect secrecy.
    \item \textbf{Perfect Secrecy:} Every plaintext has equal probability to be encrypted to a given ciphertext, making it information-theoretically secure.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Computational vs. Information-Theoretic Security:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 128-bit AES encryption: Computationally secure.
    \item One-Time Pad: Information-theoretically secure. Given a ciphertext, the plaintext can be anything from the plaintext space since the key length equals the plaintext length.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Redundancy Check:}

Redundancy checks, like CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), detect and potentially rectify changes in messages.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can this be used against modifications of encrypted data by adversaries? No, because adversaries can compute CRC for modified data. Cryptographic solutions, like hash functions, are essential.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Freshness:}

Ensuring the "freshness" of data can prevent replay attacks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Prevention methods: Use timestamps or message sequence numbers.
    \item Importance: Always define the attack model first and then design a solution for the threat.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Symmetric Key Cryptography}

Symmetric means that the keys used in security-related transformations (encryption, decryption) in both sender and receiver sides are the same.

Both entities must have the key \(k\) in a secure way.

\noindent\textbf{Symmetric Encryption Algorithm Definition:}

Let \( \mathcal{K} \), \( \mathcal{P} \), \( \mathcal{C} \), \( E \), and \( D \) define the encryption algorithm where:
\begin{align*}
& E: \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \\
& D: \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P} \\
& \forall p \in \mathcal{P}, k \in \mathcal{K} \quad D(k, E(k, p)) = p
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \mathcal{K} \) represents the \textbf{key space}. This denotes the set of all potential keys that could be utilized for both encryption and decryption in a symmetric encryption scheme. When we refer to \( k \in \mathcal{K} \), it signifies an individual key selected from this key space.

    \item \( \mathcal{P} \) denotes the \textbf{plaintext space}, which is the set of all conceivable plaintexts that can be encrypted. An element \( p \in \mathcal{P} \) refers to a specific plaintext message from this set.
\end{itemize}

The notation \( \forall p \in \mathcal{P}, k \in \mathcal{K} \) underscores a behavior or property that remains true for every possible combination of plaintext and key. Specifically, in the definition:

\[
\forall p \in \mathcal{P}, k \in \mathcal{K} \quad D(k, E(k, p)) = p
\]

This states that for every conceivable plaintext \( p \) and every possible key \( k \), if one encrypts \( p \) using \( k \) to produce a certain ciphertext, then decrypts that ciphertext using the identical key \( k \), the original plaintext \( p \) is retrieved. This emphasizes the fundamental correctness of the encryption and decryption operations: they perfectly reverse each other, provided the same key is used for both functions.

\subsection*{Block Ciphers}

Block ciphers are a category of symmetric encryption algorithms that operate on fixed-size blocks of plaintext to produce fixed-size blocks of ciphertext. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block Length (\( n \))}: This refers to the size (in bits) of the input data block that the cipher operates on. For instance, a block cipher with a block length of 128 bits operates on 128 bits of plaintext at a time to produce 128 bits of ciphertext.

    \item \textbf{Key Size (\( m \))}: The size (in bits) of the key used for encryption and decryption. The size of the key determines the number of possible keys in the key space.

    \item \textbf{Key Space (\( \mathcal{K} \))}: The set of all possible keys that can be used for encryption and decryption. Specifically, \( \mathcal{K} = \{0,1\}^m \), implying that there are \( 2^m \) potential keys.

    \item \textbf{Plaintext Space (\( \mathcal{P} \)) and Ciphertext Space (\( \mathcal{C} \))}: Both the plaintext and ciphertext spaces are defined as \( \{0,1\}^n \), meaning each plaintext or ciphertext block consists of \( n \) bits. Thus, there are \( 2^n \) possible n-bit blocks.

    \item \textbf{Encryption (\( E \)) and Decryption (\( D \)) Functions}: 
    \begin{align*}
        & E: \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{C} \\
        & D: \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}
    \end{align*}
    The encryption function takes a key and a plaintext block as input and produces a ciphertext block. The decryption function, conversely, takes a key and a ciphertext block and recovers the original plaintext block.

    \item \textbf{Correctness Property}: For every possible key \( k \) and every possible plaintext block \( p \), decrypting the encryption of \( p \) using \( k \) should return \( p \). Formally, \( \forall p \in \mathcal{P}, k \in \mathcal{K} \quad D(k, E(k, p)) = p \).
\end{itemize}

In practice, when a message is encrypted using a block cipher, it is first divided into \( n \)-bit blocks (where \( n \) is the block size of the encryption algorithm). Each of these blocks is then encrypted individually using the same key \( k \). The resulting ciphertext blocks are concatenated to produce the final encrypted message. Decryption operates in a similar manner, decrypting each block separately and then concatenating them to recover the original message.

\subsection*{Stream Ciphers}

Stream ciphers are a type of symmetric encryption algorithm that encrypts plaintext one bit (or sometimes one byte) at a time. They differ from block ciphers, which operate on fixed-size blocks of data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Key Expansion}: Unlike block ciphers, stream ciphers do not operate on fixed blocks of plaintext. Instead, a short key is expanded into a longer key stream that is as long as the message. This key stream is generated using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) or a similar mechanism.

    \item \textbf{Encryption Process}: The generated key stream is combined with the plaintext, typically using the bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) operation, to produce the ciphertext. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
    \[
    E_{IV, k, p} = G(IV, k) \oplus p
    \]
    where \( E \) is the encryption process, \( G \) is the key stream generator, \( IV \) is the initialization vector, \( k \) is the key, and \( p \) is the plaintext.

    \item \textbf{Initialization Vector (IV)}: Stream ciphers often use an IV along with the key to produce the key stream. The IV ensures that the same key produces different key streams for different sessions or messages, thereby ensuring that the same plaintext does not result in the same ciphertext across sessions. The IV is typically sent along with the ciphertext to the receiver, as it is required for decryption but doesn't need to be kept secret.

    \item \textbf{Importance of IV}: Without the use of an IV, encrypting two different messages with the same key would produce key streams \( ks \) that could lead to vulnerabilities. For instance, given ciphertexts \( c1 = p1 \oplus ks \) and \( c2 = p2 \oplus ks \), an attacker could compute:
    \[
    c1 \oplus c2 = (p1 \oplus ks) \oplus (p2 \oplus ks) = p1 \oplus p2
    \]
    This would reveal information about the XOR of the two plaintexts, which is a significant security risk. The use of an IV ensures that the key streams are different for different encryptions, mitigating this risk.
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, stream ciphers offer flexibility in encrypting data of varying lengths, but care must be taken to ensure the key stream is unique for each encryption to maintain security.


\subsection*{Comparison: Block Ciphers vs. Stream Ciphers}

Block ciphers and stream ciphers are both symmetric encryption algorithms, but they have distinct characteristics and are suited for different use cases. Here is a comparison between the two:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance for Short Messages}: Stream ciphers can be slower than block ciphers for short messages. This is primarily due to the initialization steps in stream ciphers to produce the key stream. In contrast, block ciphers, with their fixed block size, are more efficient for these shorter lengths.
    
    \item \textbf{Performance for Long Messages}: For longer messages, stream ciphers tend to have better performance. Once the key stream is generated, encryption is a simple matter of XORing the key stream with the plaintext, which can be very fast.

    \item \textbf{Offline Key Stream Generation}: One advantage of stream ciphers is that the key stream can be generated offline, ahead of time. When encryption needs to be performed, the message can simply be XORed with the pre-generated key stream, allowing for potentially faster real-time encryption.

    \item \textbf{Trend Towards Lightweight Block Ciphers}: There is a growing trend in the design and analysis of lightweight block ciphers. These ciphers are designed to require fewer resources, making them suitable for applications with constraints on area, battery power, and other resources.
\end{itemize}

While both block and stream ciphers have their strengths, the choice between them largely depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the data being encrypted.


\subsection*{Structure of Block Ciphers}

Block ciphers are cryptographic algorithms that encrypt data in fixed-size blocks, typically using a symmetric key. They are designed to provide both confusion and diffusion, ensuring that the relationship between the plaintext, ciphertext, and key is complex and non-obvious.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Round Functions}: Block ciphers operate using multiple rounds of encryption. Each round applies a series of transformations to the input data, increasing the complexity of the encryption.

    \item \textbf{Round Output}: The output of each round is determined by the round key and the output of the previous round. For the first round, the input is the plaintext, while the output of the last round is the ciphertext.

    \item \textbf{Key Schedule}: A key schedule algorithm is used to derive round keys from the main encryption key. This ensures that each round uses a different key, enhancing security.

    \item \textbf{Substitution and Permutation}: Block ciphers use a combination of substitution (non-linear transformation) and permutation (linear transformation) operations in their round functions. This combination ensures both confusion (making the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext complex) and diffusion (ensuring that changes to the plaintext spread out in the ciphertext).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) Based Algorithm Structure}

The Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) is a common structure for block ciphers. It involves multiple rounds of substituting input bits with different bits (using S-boxes) and then permuting or rearranging those bits (using a linear layer). The process can be visualized as:

\begin{verbatim}
   Plaintext
       |
   XOR with 1st round key
       |
   S-box substitutions
       |
   Linear Layer
       |
   ... (repeated for multiple rounds)
       |
   XOR with r-th round key
       |
   Ciphertext
\end{verbatim}

In this structure, the S-boxes provide non-linear transformations, ensuring complexity, while the linear layer ensures diffusion, spreading out changes across the ciphertext.

\subsubsection*{Feistel Type Structure}

Feistel ciphers are a specific type of block cipher structure. Their main characteristics include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Division of Input}: The input to each round is divided into two halves.

    \item \textbf{Update and Swap}: Only one half is updated in each round, using a function often referred to as the \(F\) function. At the end of the round, the two halves are swapped.

    \item \textbf{\(F\) Function}: The \(F\) function typically involves adding the round key, a non-linear transformation such as an S-box (substitution box), and a linear transformation like a permutation.
\end{itemize}

The Feistel structure ensures that even though only half of the data is transformed in each round, changes propagate through the entire block over multiple rounds.

\subsubsection*{Data Encryption Standard (DES)}

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. Established in 1977 by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), DES has played a foundational role in the development of modern encryption techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Origins}: DES is derived from the earlier LUCIFER cipher, designed by H. Feistel and others at IBM in 1970.
    \item \textbf{Structure}: It is structured as a Feistel cipher, consisting of 16 rounds of processing for each 64-bit block.
    \item \textbf{Key Size}: The algorithm uses a 56-bit key, providing a balance between security and performance at the time of its design.
    \item \textbf{Round Function Inputs}: The round function of DES takes a 32-bit input and combines it with a 48-bit round key.
    \item \textbf{Cryptanalysis}: DES is susceptible to differential and linear cryptanalysis, vulnerabilities that stem from its structure and key size.
    \item \textbf{Brute-Force Attacks}: The 56-bit key size, while substantial at its inception, is now considered small enough to be vulnerable to brute-force attacks with modern computing power.
\end{itemize}

DES's legacy in cryptography is significant, illustrating the evolution of cryptographic techniques and the ongoing challenge of maintaining security against increasing computational capabilities.

\subsubsection*{Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)}

Triple DES, often referred to as 3DES, is an enhancement of the original Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, designed to provide stronger security through layered encryption:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Introduction}: 3DES was proposed in 1979 as a response to the vulnerabilities of DES, particularly its susceptibility to brute-force attacks.
    \item \textbf{Key Size Variants}: The algorithm supports key sizes of 112 bits (with \( k1 = k3 \)) and 168 bits, effectively doubling and tripling the DES key size, respectively.
    \item \textbf{Encryption-Decryption-Encryption (E-D-E) Structure}: 3DES uses a sequence of three DES operations; encryption with \( k1 \), decryption with \( k2 \), and a final encryption with \( k3 \). The decryption step with \( k2 \) doesn't reverse the initial encryption because it uses a different key, thereby contributing to the overall encryption process.
    \item \textbf{Backward Compatibility with DES}: In scenarios where \( k1 = k2 = k3 \), 3DES simplifies to the original DES algorithm. This design allows 3DES to operate in environments where only DES is supported, ensuring backward compatibility.
\end{itemize}

By applying the DES cipher three times to each data block, 3DES significantly increases the difficulty of brute-force attacks, making it a more secure option at the time of its development.

\subsubsection*{Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)}

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the result of a competition held by NIST to find a robust encryption standard for securing sensitive government information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Selection as Standard}: AES was selected as the new standard algorithm for the United States in 1998, succeeding DES due to its higher security level.
    \item \textbf{Origin}: Originally named Rijndael, AES was designed by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, who submitted it to the NIST competition.
    \item \textbf{Block Length}: It operates on 128-bit blocks, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of applications and platforms.
    \item \textbf{Key Sizes}: AES supports multiple key lengths of 128, 192, and 256 bits, accommodating various security requirements and computational constraints.
    \item \textbf{Number of Rounds}: The algorithm's rounds depend on the key length; 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.
    \item \textbf{FIPS Standardization}: AES was standardized as FIPS 197 in November 2001, reinforcing its credibility and adoption in cryptographic applications.
    \item \textbf{8-bit Operations}: All operations in AES are performed on 8-bit bytes. This byte-oriented approach enhances the algorithm's performance across diverse computing platforms, from hardware implementations to software execution.
\end{itemize}

AES's adoption is widespread, becoming the de facto encryption technique for various industries due to its strength and efficiency.


\subsubsection*{Stream Ciphers}

Stream ciphers are a type of symmetric encryption where plaintext is combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (key stream). Each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the key stream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Key Length}: Typically, stream ciphers use shorter key lengths compared to block ciphers, which can be advantageous in resource-constrained environments.
    \item \textbf{Key Stream Generation}: A smaller key can be expanded to produce the required number of key bits, creating a key stream that can be as long as the plaintext.
    \item \textbf{Initialization Vectors (IV)}: To maintain security, different IVs are used for each plaintext. This ensures that the same plaintext will produce different ciphertexts each time it is encrypted.
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
    &\text{For encryption: } &F(k, IV, p) &= G(k, IV) \oplus p = c, \\
    &\text{For decryption: } &E(k, IV, c) &= G(k, IV) \oplus c = p, \\
    &\text{where } &G &: \text{key stream generator.}
\end{align*}

Despite the practicality of stream ciphers in certain applications, they are not considered perfectly secure. The key stream must never be reused, as this can lead to vulnerabilities.

\subsubsection*{Trivium}

Trivium is a noteworthy example of a stream cipher that emphasizes simplicity and speed, particularly in hardware implementations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Standardization}: It is recognized as part of the ISO/IEC 29192-3 standard, reflecting its acceptance in international cryptographic practices.
    \item \textbf{Origins}: Developed under the eSTREAM project, Trivium was designed to be a lightweight cipher suitable for a wide range of applications.
    \item \textbf{Designers}: The cipher was created by Christophe De Cannière and Bart Preneel, who are known for their contributions to cryptographic algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Internal State and Registers}: Trivium operates with a 288-bit internal state and consists of three distinct shift registers that interact during the cipher's execution.
    \item \textbf{Operation}: In each round of the cipher, a bit is shifted into each register, and simultaneously, a single output bit (\( z_i \)) is produced, contributing to the keystream.
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: The key and IV are loaded into the registers, followed by 1152 initialization rounds to ensure diffusion and avoid any simple relations between the key, IV, and the beginning of the output keystream.
\end{itemize}

The design of Trivium allows for efficient implementation while maintaining a high level of security, making it a practical choice for systems with limited computational resources.


\subsection*{Modes of Operation}

Encryption modes define how block ciphers process plaintext to produce ciphertext. Two basic types are commonly distinguished:

\subsubsection*{Monoalphabetic vs. Polyalphabetic Modes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Monoalphabetic:} In this type of encryption mode, the encryption of each plaintext block is independent of its position in the sequence. This means that identical plaintext blocks will result in identical ciphertext blocks.
    \item \textbf{Polyalphabetic:} Contrary to monoalphabetic, in polyalphabetic modes, the encryption of a plaintext block depends on its position in the sequence. This results in different ciphertexts for identical plaintext blocks occurring at different positions.
    \item \textbf{Electronic Code Book (ECB):} This is a basic form of block cipher encryption where each block of plaintext is encrypted independently. ECB falls under the category of monoalphabetic encryption. However, its simplistic nature leads to security vulnerabilities, as patterns in the plaintext may remain visible in the ciphertext.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Security of ECB Mode:}
Is ECB mode secure? No. The lack of dependency between encrypted blocks in ECB mode leads to significant vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with large data sets or repetitive information. It fails to disguise data patterns, making it susceptible to cryptanalysis.

\subsubsection*{Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Characteristics:} In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. This means that each ciphertext block depends on all plaintext blocks processed up to that point.
    \item \textbf{Monoalphabetic or Polyalphabetic:} CBC mode is classified as polyalphabetic because the encryption of each plaintext block is influenced by its position in the sequence and the preceding ciphertext blocks.
    \item \textbf{Effect of a One Bit Change:} A one-bit change in the second ciphertext block in CBC mode will result in the complete change of the subsequent plaintext block during decryption. This property, known as error propagation, highlights the interdependence of blocks in CBC mode.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hash Functions}

Hash functions are fundamental in cryptography, serving as a way to convert variable-length input into a fixed-length value, commonly referred to as a digest. Key properties of cryptographic hash functions include:

\subsubsection*{Preimage Resistance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} For a given digest \( d \), it must be computationally hard to find a message \( M \) such that \( H(M) = d \).
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Bound:} The theoretical bound to find a preimage for a given digest \( d \) is \( 2^{|d|} \) hash function calls. This is based on the principle that for a randomly chosen message \( M' \), \( \text{Pr}[H(M')=d]=2^{-|d|} \). Thus, the digest of one of \( 2^{|d|} \) randomly chosen messages will be \( d \).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Second Preimage Resistance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} For a given message \( M \), it must be computationally hard to find a different message \( M' \) such that \( H(M')=H(M) \).
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Bound:} The theoretical bound to find a second preimage for a given digest \( d \) is \( 2^{|d|} \), for reasons similar to those outlined in preimage resistance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Collision Resistance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} It must be computationally hard to find a message pair \( M \) and \( M' \) such that \( H(M')=H(M) \).
    \item \textbf{Theoretical Bound:} The theoretical bound to find a collision is \( 2^{|d|/2} \) due to the birthday paradox. The birthday paradox suggests that the probability of two randomly selected messages having the same digest increases significantly with the square root of the possible digest values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Birthday Paradox in Cryptography}

The Birthday Paradox addresses the counterintuitive probability of collisions in a set, having significant implications in cryptographic hash functions.

\subsubsection*{Collision Probability Calculation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scenario:} Considering randomly chosen \( t \) elements (\( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_t \)) from a set \( A \), we assess the probability that there exists a pair (\( x_i, x_j \)) such that \( i \neq j \) and \( x_i = x_j \) (collision).
    \item \textbf{Probability Computation:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The probability that \( x_2 \) differs from \( x_1 \) is \( \frac{|A|-1}{|A|} \).
        \item Continuing this logic, the probability that \( x_t \) differs from all preceding \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{t-1} \) is \( \frac{|A|-(t-1)}{|A|} \).
        \item Consequently, the probability that all values are different is the product:
        \[
        \prod_{i=1}^{t-1} \left(1 - \frac{i}{|A|}\right)
        \]
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Approximation:} Using the approximation \( 1 + x \approx e^x \) for \( x \ll 1 \), we derive the probability of no collision as:
    \[
    e^{-\frac{1}{|A|}(1 + 2 + \cdots + (t-1))} = e^{-\frac{1}{|A|} \frac{t(t-1)}{2}}
    \]
    \item \textbf{Collision Probability:} Hence, the probability of having at least one collision is:
    \[
    1 - e^{-\frac{1}{|A|} \frac{t(t-1)}{2}}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Determining the Collision Threshold:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Goal:} To find the minimum number of elements \( t \) required to achieve a collision probability greater than \( \frac{1}{2} \).
    \item \textbf{Calculation:} 
    \[
    1 - e^{-\frac{1}{|A|} \frac{t(t-1)}{2}} > \frac{1}{2}
    \]
    \item \textbf{Approximation:} This leads to the inequality:
    \[
    t(t-1) > 2|A| \ln 2
    \]
    Approximating, we find \( t \) to be greater than approximately \( 1.38 \times \sqrt{|A|} \).
    \item \textbf{Application:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the traditional birthday problem with \( |A|=365 \), a group size larger than 23 (since \( 1.38 \times \sqrt{365} \approx 22.44 \)) is likely to have at least one shared birthday.
        \item In hash functions with a digest size \( |d| \), computing \( 2^{|d|/2} \) random message digests will likely result in at least two messages having the same digest, illustrating the collision resistance limit of hash functions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Hash Function Constructions}

Cryptographic hash functions often use specific constructions to ensure their security properties. Two notable constructions are the Merkle-Damgård and Davies-Meyer.

\subsubsection*{Merkle-Damgård Construction:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Process:} The input message is divided into equal-sized blocks, which are then processed sequentially through a compression function. This iterative process ensures that the final output (the hash) depends on every part of the input message.
    \item \textbf{Length Padding:} Messages are padded with a bit pattern, typically '100...0', followed by the length of the message. This padding is crucial to ensure that different messages do not produce the same hash due to coincidental alignment or similar endings.
    \item \textbf{Finalization:} An optional finalization step can be added to further randomize the hash output.
    \item \textbf{Provable Security:} The security of the Merkle-Damgård construction is directly tied to the collision resistance of its compression function. If the compression function is collision-resistant, so is the overall hash function.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Davies-Meyer Construction:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compression Function:} This construction uses a block cipher as the basis for its compression function.
    \item \textbf{Provable Security:} The Davies-Meyer construction is provably secure (collision-resistant) under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is secure. This means that the ability to find collisions in the hash function is equivalent to breaking the security of the block cipher.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{SHA-1 and Its Successors}

SHA-1 is a widely recognized cryptographic hash function, with a notable history and evolution leading to more secure successors.

\subsubsection*{SHA-1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design and Origin:} SHA-1, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), is based on Ron Rivest's MD4 and MD5 designs. Initially released as SHA in 1993, SHA-1 was introduced in 1995.
    \item \textbf{Output Size:} It produces a 160-bit hash value, commonly rendered as a 40-digit hexadecimal number.
    \item \textbf{Vulnerabilities:} In 2005, significant flaws were discovered in SHA-1, indicating vulnerabilities to collision attacks.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{SHA-2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Introduction:} As a response to the vulnerabilities in SHA-1, SHA-2 was developed, offering enhanced security features.
    \item \textbf{Variants:} SHA-2 includes variants with 256- and 512-bit output sizes, significantly increasing its resistance to collision attacks compared to SHA-1.
    \item \textbf{Current Security:} SHA-2 remains secure and widely used in various cryptographic applications and protocols.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{SHA-3:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development:} SHA-3, developed through a public competition, was finalized in 2012. The winning algorithm was Keccak.
    \item \textbf{Distinct Approach:} Unlike SHA-2, SHA-3 is not based on the Merkle-Damgård construction, instead using a unique sponge construction, which provides a higher level of security and flexibility.
    \item \textbf{Role:} SHA-3 complements SHA-2, offering an alternative in case future vulnerabilities are discovered in the SHA-2 family.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Message Authentication Codes (MACs)}

Message Authentication Codes (MACs) play a crucial role in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of messages in cryptographic communication.

\subsubsection*{Concept and Operation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basic Principle:} MACs can be considered as keyed hash functions. They take a key \( K \) and a message \( M \) and output an authentication tag \( t \).
    \item \textbf{Construction Methods:} MACs can be constructed using either hash functions (hash-based MAC algorithms) or block ciphers (block cipher-based MAC algorithms).
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} MACs are used to verify both the integrity and authenticity of messages.
    \item \textbf{Process:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The sender and receiver share a symmetric key securely.
        \item The sender computes the MAC tag of the message and sends both the message and the tag over an insecure channel.
        \item Upon receipt, the receiver computes the MAC tag of the received message using the pre-shared key and compares it with the received tag.
        \item If the tags match, the receiver can be confident that the message has not been altered and can authenticate the source, assuming the key is only known to the sender and receiver.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Non-Repudiation:} A key question is whether MACs can be used for non-repudiation. Since MACs require a shared secret key, they are generally not suitable for non-repudiation purposes. Non-repudiation requires proof that cannot be repudiated by either party, typically achieved through digital signatures using asymmetric cryptography.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{SHA-1 HMAC:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hash-Based MAC:} HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using SHA-1 is a widely used hash-based MAC algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Source:} More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{CBC MAC:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block Cipher-Based MAC:} CBC MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code) is a MAC algorithm that uses a block cipher in CBC mode.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Authenticated Encryption Algorithms}

Authenticated encryption algorithms are critical in ensuring both confidentiality and integrity of messages in insecure communication channels.

\subsubsection*{Need for Authenticated Encryption:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Confidentiality and Integrity:} To secure messages effectively, it's important to maintain not only confidentiality but also message integrity. Encryption alone does not guarantee integrity.
    \item \textbf{Traditional Approach:} The recommended method involves encrypting the message using an encryption key \( k1 \), then computing an authentication code of the ciphertext using a separate MAC key \( k2 \). The sender transmits both the ciphertext and the tag to the receiver, who verifies the tag before decrypting the message.
    \item \textbf{Two-Key System:} This approach requires two different keys and two different algorithms, one for encryption and one for authentication.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Integrated Authenticated Encryption:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Algorithm Solution:} Authenticated encryption algorithms are designed to provide both confidentiality and integrity within a single framework, simplifying key management and processing.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} In some cases, parts of a message may not require confidentiality but still need integrity protection.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} AEAD takes a message that requires both encryption and integrity protection, and associated data that requires only integrity protection. It uses a symmetric key to output a tag for the message and associated data, along with the ciphertext of the message.
    \item \textbf{Application:} This approach is ideal for scenarios where only a portion of the communication requires encryption, but integrity is essential for the entire message.
\end{itemize}



\section*{Public Key Cryptography (PKC)}

Public Key Cryptography represents a fundamental shift in cryptographic practices, introducing the concept of asymmetric key cryptography.

\subsection*{Introduction and Historical Background:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Significance:} PKC is considered the single most important idea in modern cryptography.
    \item \textbf{Origin:} Proposed by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, PKC introduced a new paradigm in cryptographic key management.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Asymmetric Key Cryptography:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Key Pair:} In PKC, each individual has a pair of keys: a public key (\( pk \)) and a private key (\( tk \)).
    \item \textbf{Security Principle:} It should be computationally infeasible to derive the private key (\( tk \)) from the public key (\( pk \)). This allows the public key to be openly shared.
    \item \textbf{Encryption and Decryption Process:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To encrypt a message \( p \), the sender uses the receiver's public key: \( c = F_{pk}(p) \).
        \item The receiver decrypts the ciphertext \( c \) using their private key: \( p = E_{tk}(c) \).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solving the Key Distribution Problem:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classical Challenge:} In traditional symmetric key cryptography, sharing a secret key over an insecure channel poses a significant challenge.
    \item \textbf{PKC Solution:} With PKC, a person can make their public key \( pk \) available to anyone. This allows anyone to send them an encrypted message, but only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt these messages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Message Source Authentication:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Signing Messages:} PKC allows an individual to 'sign' a message using their private key. This signature is unique and verifiable.
    \item \textbf{Verification:} Anyone with access to the public key can verify the signature, thus authenticating the message source.
    \item \textbf{Non-Repudiation:} This feature also provides non-repudiation, as only the owner of the private key could have created the signature.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange}

The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a fundamental protocol in public key cryptography for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.

\subsection*{Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Problem Statement:} The DLP asks: given \( g \) and \( y = g^x \), what is \( x \)?
    \item \textbf{Difficulty:} While the problem is easy to solve over \( \mathbb{Z} \) (the integers), it becomes hard over \( \mathbb{Z}_p \) (integers modulo a prime \( p \)).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Public Information:} A prime number \( p \) and a generator \( g \).
    \item \textbf{Private Selections:} Alice chooses a random secret \( a \), and Bob chooses a random secret \( b \).
    \item \textbf{Exchange:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alice sends \( g^a \mod p \) to Bob.
        \item Bob sends \( g^b \mod p \) to Alice.
        \item Both compute the shared secret \( K = g^{ab} \mod p \) independently.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security of Diffie-Hellman:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DLP and DH Problem (DHP):} The DHP asks: given \( p, g, g^a \mod p, g^b \mod p \), what is \( g^{ab} \mod p \)? It's conjectured that solving DHP is as hard as solving DLP.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Efficiency of Diffie-Hellman:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Repeated Squaring Method:} A common technique for efficiently computing \( g^a \mod p \) involves repeated squaring, starting with the most significant bit of the exponent.
    \item \textbf{Example:} To compute \( 3^{25} \mod 20 \):
    \begin{align*}
        y_0 &= 3^1 \mod 20 = 3 \\
        y_1 &= 3^{11} \mod 20 = 3^2 \cdot 3 \mod 20 = 7 \\
        y_2 &= 3^{110} \mod 20 = 7^2 \mod 20 = 9 \\
        y_3 &= 3^{1100} \mod 20 = 9^2 \mod 20 = 1 \\
        y_4 &= 3^{11001} \mod 20 = 1^2 \cdot 3 \mod 20 = 3
    \end{align*}
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing:} Further efficiency can be gained by preprocessing \( x^i \) for \( i < 2^k \), for some \( k \).
\end{itemize}


\section*{RSA Cryptosystem}

        \item Compute \( \varphi(N) = (p-1)(q-1) \).
        \item Choose \( e \) such that \( \gcd(e, \varphi(N)) = 1 \).
        \item Compute \( d = e^{-1} \mod \varphi(N) \) (i.e., \( de \equiv 1 \mod \varphi(N) \)).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Public and Private Keys:} \( N, e \) are public, \( d \) is the private key.
    \item \textbf{Encryption:} \( E(x) = x^e \mod N \)
    \item \textbf{Decryption:} \( D(x) = x^d \mod N \)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security and Efficiency of RSA:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:} Based on the difficulty of factoring \( N \). Finding \( d \) is equivalent to factoring \( N \).
    \item \textbf{Suggested Key Lengths:} Short term - 2048 bits, longer term - 4096 bits.
    \item \textbf{Parameter Generation:} \( p, q \) should be random. Common choices for \( e \) include 3 and 65537.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RSA Encryption and Signature Issues:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Guessable Plaintext Problem:} If \( x \) is from a small domain, it may be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    \item \textbf{Multiplicative Property and Existential Forgery:} These issues necessitate proper padding and hashing in practical implementations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{RSA in Practice:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PKCS \#1:} A standard by RSA Labs describing the proper use of RSA.
    \item \textbf{Padding Schemes:} For encryption, random padding is used to prevent plaintext prediction. For signatures, fixed padding and hashing prevent obtaining valid signature-message pairs.
\end{itemize}

\section*{ElGamal Cryptosystem and Variants}

The ElGamal Cryptosystem is a public key system based on the discrete logarithm problem. It offers both encryption and signature schemes.

\subsection*{Structure of \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a prime \( p \), \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \) is the set of all non-zero elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_p \).
    \item \textbf{Fermat’s Little Theorem:} For all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}_p^* \), \( x^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \).
    \item The order of an element is the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( g^k \equiv 1 \mod p \).
    \item Fact: Every \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \) for prime \( p \) has a generator.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ElGamal Encryption:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parameters:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose a large prime \( p \) and a generator \( g \) of \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \).
        \item Select \( \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} \), and compute \( \beta = g^\alpha \mod p \).
        \item Public key: \( p, g, \beta \); private key: \( \alpha \).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Encryption Process:} To encrypt plaintext \( x \),
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose a random \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{p-1} \).
        \item Compute ciphertext as \( (r, s) \), where \( r = g^k \mod p \) and \( s = x \cdot \beta^k \mod p \).
        \item Decryption uses \( D(r, s) = s \cdot (r^\alpha)^{-1} \mod p \).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ElGamal Signature Scheme:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Signature Generation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the same parameters as in encryption.
        \item To sign a message \( m \), choose a random \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_{p-1}^* \).
        \item Compute \( (r, s) \) as \( r = g^k \mod p \) and \( s = (m - r\alpha) \cdot k^{-1} \mod (p-1) \).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verification:} Check if \( \beta^r \cdot r^s \equiv g^m \mod p \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Security Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dependence on DLP:} The security of ElGamal relies on the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem.
    \item \textbf{Key Reuse:} Using the same \( k \) for different signatures can compromise the private key.
    \item \textbf{Variants:} Several variants exist, especially in the signature scheme, by altering the signing equation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ElGamal in Practice:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Schnorr Groups:} Utilize subgroups of \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \) for efficiency.
    \item \textbf{RSA vs. ElGamal:} ElGamal provides an alternative to RSA, particularly in scenarios where RSA's multiplicative property is a concern.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)}

The Digital Signature Algorithm is a standard for digital signatures developed by the United States government and the National Security Agency.

\subsection*{Background and Characteristics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Origin:} DSA is based on the ElGamal Signature Scheme and Schnorr signatures. 
    \item \textbf{Patent-Free:} Unlike RSA, DSA is not encumbered by patents.
    \item \textbf{Usage Limitation:} DSA is designed solely for digital signatures and cannot be used for encryption.
    \item \textbf{Objections:} Initial objections to DSA included its relatively untested nature compared to RSA, slower verification, and the industry's existing investment in RSA technology.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{DSA Parameters and Keys:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parameters:} Choose primes \( p \) and \( q \) where \( q \mid (p-1) \), and \( g \in \mathbb{Z}_p^* \) of order \( q \). Use a hash function \( H: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q \).
    \item \textbf{Keys:} The private key is \( \alpha \in \mathbb{Z}_q \); the public key is \( \beta = g^\alpha \mod p \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Signature Generation and Verification:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Signature:} For a message \( M \), the signature is a pair \( (r, s) \) where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Choose a random \( k \in \mathbb{Z}_q \).
        \item Compute \( v = g^k \mod p \) and \( r = v \mod q \).
        \item Compute \( s = (H(M) + r \cdot \alpha) \cdot k^{-1} \mod q \).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verification:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compute \( v' = g^{H(M)} \cdot s^{-1} \cdot \beta^{r} \cdot s^{-1} \mod p \).
        \item Check if \( r \equiv v' \mod q \).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Advantages of DSA:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reduced Size:} The signature components \( r \) and \( s \) in DSA are typically 160 bits each, making the signature more compact compared to RSA.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems}

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a public key encryption technique based on elliptic curves over finite fields. It offers advantages in terms of efficiency and security.

\subsection*{Generalized Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In any group \( (G, \cdot) \), for \( x \in G \), define \( x^n = x \cdot x \cdot \ldots \cdot x \) (\( n \) times).
    \item \textbf{DLP:} Given \( y = x^n \), for known \( x, y \), find \( n \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Elliptic Curves over \( \mathbb{Z}_p \):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Definition:} The set of points \( (x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p \) satisfying \( y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \mod p \), along with an additional point at infinity, denoted as 0.
    \item \textbf{Group Operation:} For points \( P \) and \( Q \) on the curve, \( P \cdot Q \) is the inverse of the third intersection point of the line through \( P \) and \( Q \) with the curve. The inverse of \( P = (x, y) \) is \( P^{-1} = (x, -y) \).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Properties and Advantages of ECC:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Exponentiation operations on elliptic curves are efficient.
    \item \textbf{Security:} The elliptic curve DLP is considered harder than the traditional DLP in \( \mathbb{Z}_p \), allowing for smaller key sizes with equivalent security.

    \item \textbf{Comparison with RSA:} ECC offers advantages such as smaller key sizes, compact hardware implementation, and faster private key operations.
    \item \textbf{Endorsement:} ECC is licensed and recommended by the NSA.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ECC vs. RSA - Key Size Comparison:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NIST guidelines suggest significantly smaller key sizes for ECC compared to RSA/DH/ElGamal for equivalent security levels. For instance, a 160-bit ECC key offers similar security to a 1024-bit RSA key.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Key Management in Public Key Cryptography}

Key management is a crucial aspect of PKC, addressing challenges like passive and active attacks, and establishing trust through third parties.

\subsection*{Key Distribution and MitM Attacks:}

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Certificate Management and Revocation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Revocation:} Mechanisms like Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and online revocation servers ensure that compromised certificates are invalidated.
    \item \textbf{X.509 Certificates:} A common standard for certificates, detailing fields like serial number, issuer, validity period, and public key information.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Comparison: KDC vs. CA:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{KDC:} Based on symmetric keys, faster but needs to be online, suitable for LANs.
    \item \textbf{CA:} Doesn't need to be online, more scalable for WANs like the Internet, and provides better privacy as it cannot decrypt conversations.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Salting:} Adding a random value to passwords before hashing to prevent pre-computed table attacks.
    \item \textbf{Secure Password Hashing:} Using computationally intensive hashing methods to slow down attackers. Examples include PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt, and Argon2.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Cryptographic Authentication}

Cryptographic authentication involves using cryptographic techniques to verify the identity of users or systems, addressing the limitations of simple password authentication.

\subsection*{Symmetric Key Challenge-Response:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Protocol Example:} In a scenario where Alice and Bob share a symmetric key \( K_{AB} \), and \( F \) is a cryptographic function (like hash or encryption):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alice initiates authentication.
        \item Bob sends a random challenge \( R \).
        \item Alice responds with \( F(K_{AB}, R) \).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Use in WPA2:} This method is employed in Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) for secure wireless communication.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mutual Authentication:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dual Verification:} Both parties, Alice and Bob, authenticate each other.
    \item \textbf{Example Protocol:} Using random numbers \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) generated by Bob and Alice, respectively, they each prove their identity by correctly responding to the other's challenge.
    \item \textbf{Reflection Attack Prevention:} Use different keys or formatted challenges to prevent reflection attacks, where the adversary establishes parallel sessions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Key Establishment with KDC:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Protocol:} A KDC facilitates secure communication by providing a session key \( K_{AB} \) to both Alice and Bob.
    \item \textbf{Pre-Shared Keys:} Alice and Bob each have a pre-shared key with the KDC (\( K_A \) and \( K_B \), respectively).
    \item \textbf{Freshness Concern:} Protocols need to ensure the freshness of \( K_{AB} \) to prevent replay attacks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Considerations in Cryptographic Authentication:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dictionary Attacks:} If \( K_{AB} \) is derived from a password, there is a risk of dictionary attacks. Protocols must be designed to mitigate this.
    \item \textbf{Initiator Identity Proof:} The party initiating communication should be the first to prove its identity to prevent certain types of attacks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Needham-Schroeder Protocol}

Developed in 1978, the Needham-Schroeder Protocol is a foundational cryptographic protocol for secure authentication and key exchange.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alice initiates the protocol by sending her identity, Bob's identity, and a nonce \( R_1 \) to the Key Distribution Center (KDC).
    \item The KDC responds with a message encrypted with Bob's key \( K_B \). This message includes \( R_1 \), Bob's identity, a session key \( K_{AB} \), and a "ticket" for Bob. The ticket itself contains \( K_{AB} \) and Alice's identity, encrypted with a key \( K_C \).
    \item Alice sends this ticket to Bob, along with a message encrypted with \( K_{AB} \) containing a new nonce \( R_2 \).
    \item Bob decrypts the ticket, retrieves \( K_{AB} \), and uses it to send back a message encrypted with \( K_{AB} \) containing \( R_2 - 1 \) and a new nonce \( R_3 \).
    \item Alice responds with a message encrypted with \( K_{AB} \) containing \( R_3 - 1 \), completing the mutual authentication process.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Otway-Rees Authentication Protocol}

The Otway-Rees Authentication Protocol, designed in 1987, improves upon earlier protocols by using session identifiers for enhanced security.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alice and Bob initiate the protocol by sending a message to the KDC. This message includes their identities, a session identifier \( R \), and additional random numbers \( R_A \) and \( R_B \), each encrypted with their respective keys shared with the KDC.
    \item The KDC decrypts these messages, verifies the identities and session identifier, and sends back responses to both Alice and Bob. These responses include the session key \( K_{AB} \), encrypted with each party's key.
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Kerberos Protocol}

Kerberos is a cryptographic authentication system for distributed environments, developed as part of Project Athena at MIT in the 1980s. It is widely used across various operating systems for network authentication.

\subsection*{Features and Requirements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Design Goals:} Focus on security, reliability, transparency, and scalability.
    \item \textbf{Authentication Method:} Based on symmetric-key authentication involving a Key Distribution Center (KDC).
    \item \textbf{Advantages:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Provides secure authentication mechanisms.
        \item Supports single sign-on functionality.
        \item Ensures secure data flow within the network.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Basic Kerberos Protocol}
Kerberos uses symmetric cryptography and a trusted third party (KDC) for secure key distribution and authentication.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alice requests to communicate with Bob, sending a nonce \( R_1 \), her identity, and Bob's identity to the KDC.
    \item The KDC responds with an encrypted message (using Bob's key \( K_B \)) containing \( R_1 \), Bob's identity, a session key \( K_{AB} \), and a ticket for Bob. The ticket includes \( K_{AB} \), Alice's identity, and an expiration time, encrypted with a key \( K_C \).
    \item Alice sends the ticket to Bob, along with a message encrypted with \( K_{AB} \) containing a timestamp \( T \).
    \item Bob responds with a message encrypted with \( K_{AB} \) containing \( T+1 \), completing the mutual authentication.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Kerberos Keys:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each participant, or "principal", shares a master key with the KDC.
    \item \textbf{Key Types:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( K_A \): Alice's master key, typically derived from her password, used for initial authentication.
        \item \( S_A \): Alice's session key, generated post-authentication and used instead of \( K_A \).
        \item \( K_{AB} \): Session key shared between Alice and Bob.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT):} Issued to a principal (like Alice) by the KDC after login, containing \( S_A \) and encrypted with the KDC's key. It's used to obtain session keys for specific services.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Logging into the Network:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user's workstation converts the password into a symmetric key.
    \item Upon receiving credentials from the KDC, the workstation decrypts them using this key.
    \item Successful decryption authenticates the user, and the workstation retains the TGT for future requests.
    \item The TGT contains all necessary session information, allowing the KDC to manage authentication without storing volatile data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Accessing a Remote Principal:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Post-authentication, communication between Alice and Bob (or any two principals) can vary based on security requirements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unprotected (plain text).
        \item Authenticated only.
        \item Both encrypted and authenticated.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Multiple Realms in Kerberos:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kerberos supports the concept of multiple realms, wherein different KDCs (e.g., KDC A and KDC B) can interoperate.
    \item For cross-realm authentication, KDCs must be registered with each other and trust each other's authentication processes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Message Authentication}

Message Authentication is crucial for verifying the integrity and origin of a message in cryptographic communications.

\subsection*{Early Days and Kerberos:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the 1980s, the concept of MACs (Message Authentication Codes) was not fully established.
    \item \textbf{Kerberos' Approach:} Initially, Kerberos used CRC-32 checksums combined with DES encryption to serve as a MAC.
    \item \textbf{Security Considerations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Non-Cryptographic Checksums:} Using non-crypto checksums like CRC-32 with encryption is not secure if the message is in plaintext.
        \item \textit{Block Cipher Compatibility:} With block ciphers like DES, this approach is mostly secure.
        \item \textit{Stream Cipher Compatibility:} Using CRC-32 with stream ciphers can be problematic, as demonstrated in the WEP protocol.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Major Problems with WEP:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP):} The first encryption protocol for 802.11 Wi-Fi networks.
    \item \textbf{Security Flaws:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Stream Cipher Usage:} WEP used the RC4 stream cipher for challenge-response authentication, which was not ideal.
        \item \textit{Initialization Vector (IV):} The use of a 24-bit IV increased the risk of IV collision and replay attacks.
        \item \textit{Linear Checksum with Stream Cipher:} Using CRC-32, a linear checksum, with RC4 led to significant security vulnerabilities.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Message Authentication in WEP:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MAC Algorithm in WEP:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The CRC-32 checksum is computed over the message.
        \item Both the message and the checksum are encrypted with RC4.
        \item \textbf{Vulnerability:} Since RC4 is a stream cipher, controlled changes can be made to the encrypted message while still maintaining a valid checksum, leading to potential security breaches.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Public Key Challenge-Response}

Public Key Challenge-Response mechanisms are vital in cryptographic protocols for authenticating identity using public key cryptography.

\subsection*{Challenge-Response by Signature:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Process:} Alice authenticates herself to Bob using her digital signature.
    \item \textbf{Operation:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Bob sends a random challenge \( R \) to Alice.
        \item Alice signs the challenge using her private key: \( \text{Sign}_A(R) \).
        \item Alice sends this signature back to Bob.
        \item Bob verifies the signature using Alice's public key to confirm her identity.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenge-Response by Decryption:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Process:} Alice proves her identity to Bob by decrypting a message encrypted with her public key.
    \item \textbf{Operation:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Bob sends a message encrypted with Alice's public key: \( E_A(R) \).
        \item Alice decrypts the message using her private key to retrieve \( R \).
        \item Alice sends \( R \) back to Bob to prove her identity.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Pitfalls and Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Key Management Challenges:} Remembering or safely storing public/private keys can be problematic for ordinary users.
    \item \textbf{Solutions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Store keys in an electronic token, like a USB drive.
        \item Retrieve keys from a server using password-based authentication and encryption.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security Precautions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Avoid using the same key for multiple purposes (e.g., both for logging in and signing documents).
        \item Always hash incoming challenges with context information before signing.
        \item Use formatted challenges to avoid misuse by adversaries.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section*{Nonces in Cryptographic Protocols}

Nonces, or "numbers used once", are unique values generated for a single session or transaction in cryptographic protocols, ensuring freshness and preventing replay attacks.

\subsection*{Definition and Purpose:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nonce:} A value created specifically for a single use in cryptographic communication, often to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Types of Nonces:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Numbers:} Used when unpredictability is crucial. Random nonces are ideal for scenarios where the nonce must not be guessable.
    \item \textbf{Timestamps:} Utilized in situations where synchronized clocks are available. Timestamps help in ensuring the freshness of a message or transaction.
    \item \textbf{Sequence Numbers:} Appropriate in contexts where predictability is acceptable. Sequence numbers are often used in ordered communication processes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Generation and Usage:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Nonces:} Generated using cryptographic random number generators to ensure unpredictability.
    \item \textbf{Timestamp-Based Nonces:} Can be derived by encrypting or hashing the current timestamp with a secret key to add an extra layer of security.
    \item \textbf{Sequence Numbers:} Incremented with each transaction or message, suitable for protocols where messages are expected to follow a certain order.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The choice of nonce type depends on the specific requirements of the cryptographic protocol, such as the need for unpredictability, synchronization, or order.
    \item Nonces play a critical role in securing cryptographic communications, preventing replay attacks, and ensuring the integrity of transactions.
\end{itemize}
